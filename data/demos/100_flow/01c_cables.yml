# Physical Cables for 100_flow Demo
#
# IMPORTANT: This file models ONLY physical fiber cables between equipment.
#
# Physical cables exist for:
# - DC1 → FR5/AM5: Dark fiber (owned/leased direct fiber)
#
# NO physical cables for:
# - FR5 ↔ AM5: Equinix Metro Connect (Layer 2 service, not a cable)
# - Direct Connect cross-connects: Terminate in AWS cages (not modeled)
# - DIA circuits: Terminate in ISP PoPs (not modeled)
#
# Cable endpoints reference DcimPhysicalInterface using HFID format:
# ["device_name", "interface_name"]
# Cables must be loaded AFTER interfaces (01b_interfaces.yml).

# ========================================
# FR5 <-> AM5 Metro Ethernet - NO CABLES!
# ========================================
# Equinix Metro Connect between FR5 and AM5 is a LAYER 2 SERVICE
# provided by Equinix over their backbone network. There is NO
# physical cable to model here.
#
# This connection is represented by:
# - TopologyCircuit (type: metro_ethernet) in 02_circuits.yml
# - Circuit service bindings in 02b_circuit_services.yml
# - VXLAN/GRE overlays in 03_virtual_links.yml
#
# You do NOT have access to or control over the physical infrastructure
# between Equinix facilities - this is Equinix's internal network.
