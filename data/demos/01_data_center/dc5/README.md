# DC5 - Multi-Vendor: Eurovision for Switches

## Overview

**Location:** New York 🇺🇸 (The city that never sleeps, neither does your infrastructure. Rack space cheaper than a Manhattan studio!)

**Size:** Medium (M) - Diverse, resilient, and a little bit chaotic

**Platform:** Multi-Vendor — why settle for one when you can pay four support contracts and juggle Cisco, Arista, Dell, and Edgecore all at once?

**Design Pattern:** M-Hierarchical (Medium with hierarchical naming convention)

**Use Case:**
Pod-level vendor diversity for risk mitigation and best-of-breed selection. Each pod pledges allegiance to a different vendor—like a american version of Eurovision, but with more BGP and fewer sequins. It's middle_rack deployment across all 4 pods because hierarchy transcends vendor boundaries (and so do support tickets). Perfect for testing vendor migration strategies, proving your multi-vendor expertise at parties, and discovering which vendor's CLI makes you question your life choices.

Warning: May result in spontaneous protocol debates, inter-vendor blame games, and a sudden urge to update your LinkedIn profile.

## Quick Start

```bash
# really quick
uv run inv deploy-dc --scenario dc5 --branch your_branch

# I'm the control nerd
uv run infrahubctl branch create you_branch

# Load topology (this is the point of no return)
uv run infrahubctl object load data/demos/01_data_center/dc5/ --branch you_branch

# Generate fabric (grab coffee, this might take a while)
uv run infrahubctl generator generate_dc name=DC5 --branch you_branch

```

Trigger infrastructure generation in InfraHub UI → Actions → Generator Definitions → generate_dc DC5-Fabric-1

## Fun Fact

After a trip to New York and watching movies where people order “the world’s best hot dog” delivered by plane, the author bravely sampled three different vendors—just to validate the multi-vendor strategy.

Verdict: not worth the carbon footprint, and definitely not worth explaining to customs why you’re importing a hot dog.
